# 48-Hour Validation Plan — Weekly Client Reporting Kit

## Goal
Test demand from freelancers/agencies for a done-for-you reporting workflow pack.

## Channels (48 hours)
1. LinkedIn post with before/after report screenshot concept
2. X thread on “Why clients churn from bad reporting” + CTA
3. Direct DMs to 25 freelancers/agencies offering intro price

## Offer test mechanics
- Intro at $69 for first 30 buyers
- Add “agency license” upsell interest check at $149

## Success criteria
- >= 30 landing visits
- >= 4 purchases OR >= 8 buyers requesting agency license details

## Kill criteria
- < 15 visits and < 2 qualified replies despite DM push
- Objection pattern: “Can get same in ChatGPT for free” with no differentiation resonance

## If kill triggered
Bundle into larger “Agency Ops Starter Vault” with higher perceived value and multi-template scope.
