# Overnight Launch Kit — Offer Ladder (v1)

> Purpose: increase AOV without hurting close rate for first buyers.
> 
> **Assumptions (explicit):**
> - Buyer is an affiliate/leadgen operator with at least one active offer and basic funnel stack.
> - Buyers are price-sensitive and want speed over theory.
> - No done-for-you engineering is included unless explicitly scoped in Package 3.

## Ladder Overview

| Tier | Offer | Price | Delivery | Ideal Buyer | Goal |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Core | Overnight Launch Kit | **$79 intro** (then $129) | Instant digital files | Solo operator needing launch discipline | Fast first sale / low friction |
| Upsell | Launch Review Add-On (async) | **$149** | Loom + written audit in 24h | Buyer who wants confidence before traffic | Increase conversion + AOV |
| Premium | Done-With-You Sprint (3 days) | **$599** | Live call + implementation guidance + QA pass | Operator wanting hands-on execution support | High-ticket cash + case studies |

## 1) Core Offer — Overnight Launch Kit

### Positioning
"Use this tonight, launch cleaner tomorrow."

### Includes
- Launch Readiness Scorecard
- Debt Funnel QA Checklist
- Daily Performance Control Sheet
- Storefront copy + fallback invoice flow

### Sales script (short DM)
> If you’re launching debt/affiliate funnels and want fewer day-1 mistakes, I built a practical kit with the exact scorecard + QA + daily control sheet we use. 
> 
> It’s $79 intro (first 20 buyers), then $129. One-time payment, instant files.
> 
> Want the checkout link?

### Objection handling
- **"I can do this myself."**
  - Totally fair. This just compresses setup and catches misses before spend goes out.
- **"Will this guarantee profits?"**
  - No guarantee. It improves launch process quality; results still depend on traffic + offer + execution.

## Packaging Rules

1. Never pitch premium before core fit is established.
2. Upsell only after buyer commits to core (or immediately on thank-you page).
3. Keep promises realistic: process lift, not guaranteed revenue.
4. Track close rate per tier weekly and adjust pricing after 10+ sales.

## KPI Targets (initial)

> These are **estimates**, not guarantees.

- Core conversion from warm traffic: 2–5%
- Upsell attach rate: 15–25%
- Premium conversion from core buyers: 5–10%
- Target blended AOV (first cycle): $110–$165
