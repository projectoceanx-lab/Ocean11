# SALES_PLAYBOOK.md — First 10 Sales in 72 Hours

> Objective: close first 10 paid buyers for Overnight Launch Kit within 72h.
>
> **Reality check:** this is a focused execution plan, not a guarantee. Results depend on audience quality, response rate, and speed of follow-up.

## Assumptions (explicit)

1. Product page + checkout/manual invoice fallback are live.
2. You can post from active X/Reddit/FB/IndieHackers accounts.
3. You can dedicate ~6 focused hours/day for 3 days.
4. Warm network exists (at least 50 reachable contacts/accounts).

## Revenue math target (estimate)

- Base target: 10 sales x $79 = **$790 gross**
- Stretch with upsell attach (20% at $149): +$298
- Estimated blended gross: **$790–$1,088**

## Messaging Scripts (copy/paste)

## 1) Cold DM / reply
"If you’re launching affiliate/debt funnels this week, I made a practical Overnight Launch Kit (scorecard + QA + daily control sheet) to reduce day-1 mistakes. Intro is $79 for first 20 buyers. Want the link?"

## 2) Follow-up (24h later)
"Quick nudge — intro pricing is still open right now. If you want it, I can send link or manual invoice immediately."

## 3) Objection: "Will this guarantee results?"
"No guarantee. It’s an execution toolkit to improve launch quality and speed. Your results still depend on offer + traffic + implementation."

## 4) Upsell script
"If you want extra confidence, I can add a 24h launch review (Loom + priority fixes) for $149. Want details?"

## Non-Negotiables

1. Respond to warm leads fast (SLA: <15 min while online).
2. Value-first in public communities; avoid spam drops.
3. Track every touch in `LAUNCH_OUTREACH_TRACKER.csv`.
4. Use realistic claims only. No fake earnings promises.
5. If checkout breaks, immediately route to manual invoice flow.
