## Who should use this
Affiliate and debt leadgen operators preparing to launch or relaunch a funnel with minimal wasted spend.

## How to use (30–60 minutes)
1. Fill `launch-readiness-scorecard.md` and mark all red/yellow items.

3. Use `daily-performance-control-sheet.csv` as your day-1/day-2 command center.
4. Publish the included storefront and drive traffic from your audience/email/social.

## Launch safety gates (do not skip)
- Do not send paid traffic until checkout URL is tested end-to-end.
- Keep a manual invoice fallback active if checkout is down.
- Add legal pages (privacy/terms/disclosures) before launch if not already live.
- Run one real test purchase flow before announcing publicly.

## Suggested sales mechanics
- Intro offer: **$79** for first 20 buyers
- Standard price after proof: **$129**
- Bonus option: add 15-minute launch review upsell manually

## Notes
- This kit does not include payment gateway credentials.
- If checkout provider keys are missing, sell via manual invoice/DM until gateway is connected.
