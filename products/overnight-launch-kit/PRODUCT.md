# Overnight Launch Kit

## What this is
A ready-to-run digital operations pack for affiliate/debt leadgen operators who need to launch a compliant micro-campaign quickly.

It gives you prebuilt templates, launch checklists, and execution SOPs so you can move from “idea” to “live offer test” in one morning.

## Target buyer
- Solo affiliate operators
- Small leadgen teams
- Media buyers/operators entering debt relief verticals
- Founders who need structure without hiring full ops support

## Problem
Most launches fail in the first 48 hours because:
1. Offer setup is incomplete (caps/compliance not clearly mapped)
2. Tracking + routing gaps are discovered only after traffic starts
3. Team executes ad-hoc with no single launch checklist

## Solution
The kit ships:
- A **Launch Readiness Scorecard** (find critical gaps before spend)
- A **Debt Lead Funnel QA Checklist** (compliance + conversion checks)
- A **Daily Performance Control Sheet** (spend, CPL, approval rate, cap pacing)
- A practical implementation README and a deploy-ready storefront page

## Price recommendation
**Recommended launch price: $79 (intro), then $129 after first 20 buyers.**

Why:
- Low-friction impulse buy for operators
- High perceived value vs. cost of one failed test day
- Clear path to increase price after proof + testimonials

## Positioning line
“Launch your debt leadgen micro-funnel in one morning with fewer blind spots and cleaner decision control.”

## Risk control note
This product provides operational templates/checklists only. It does not provide legal, financial, or compliance advice; buyer remains responsible for final regulatory review.
