# 48-Hour Validation Plan — Compliance Preflight Pack

## Goal
Validate whether buyers will pay for a lightweight compliance ops pack.

## Channels (48 hours)
1. LinkedIn post targeting agency owners in finance/health verticals
2. Direct outreach to 30 known operators/founders (email/DM)
3. Founder-led Loom demo posted in communities (Slack/Telegram)

## Offer test mechanics
- Intro offer at $119 for first 15 buyers
- Bonus: 15-min implementation call for first 5

## Success criteria
- >= 5 serious “need this” responses
- >= 2 paid buyers OR >= 5 booked calls with purchase intent

## Kill criteria
- Responses focus on requesting legal advice (wrong expectation)
- < 2 serious responses after full outreach list contacted

## If kill triggered
Reposition as “Compliance QA Layer for Agencies” (B2B ops angle) with higher ACV consulting upsell.
