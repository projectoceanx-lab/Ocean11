# Compliance Preflight Pack

## Problem
Operators in regulated niches ship pages/emails quickly but miss claim, consent, and disclosure basics—creating account risk and legal exposure.

## Buyer
- Affiliate operators in debt, finance, health, insurance
- Small agencies managing regulated funnels
- Founders launching offers without in-house compliance ops

## Deliverable
A practical preflight system with claim-review and consent-capture templates to reduce avoidable compliance misses before launch.

## Price
- Intro: **$119**
- Standard: **$179**

## Why now
Platform enforcement is tighter and account bans are costly. Teams need simple preflight workflows they can run daily.
