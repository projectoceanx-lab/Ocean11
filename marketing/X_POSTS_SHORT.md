# X Short Posts (10) — Overnight Launch Kit

Use with tracked link + direct CTA.

1. Most launches fail before traffic starts.
Not because of ads — because setup is broken.
I packaged the exact launch scorecard + QA flow I use into Overnight Launch Kit.
$79 intro (first 20).

2. If your funnel “looks ready” but you haven’t run a full QA pass,
you’re one click away from burning cash.
Overnight Launch Kit = checklist + control sheet + SOP.
Ship cleaner in one morning.

3. Operator truth:
A single missed cap/compliance/tracking step can kill a whole test day.
This kit is built to prevent that.
Intro: $79 for first 20 buyers.

4. Before you spend another $200 on traffic,
run this first: launch readiness scorecard + debt funnel QA.
That’s exactly what’s inside Overnight Launch Kit.
