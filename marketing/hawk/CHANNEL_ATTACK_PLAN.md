# Hawk Sprint: Prioritized Channel Attack Plan (Today)

## Objective (Next 24h)
Generate first qualified leads for **Overnight Launch Kit** with an aggressive but realistic outbound/distribution push using existing assets.

- Primary KPI: **15+ positive replies** ("send link", "interested", "tell me more")
- Secondary KPI: **3–5 checkout clicks** and first purchases/leads
- Time-to-first-reply target: **< 90 minutes** from sprint start

## Offer Snapshot (from existing product assets)
- Product: **Overnight Launch Kit**
- Buyer: affiliate/debt leadgen operators, media buyers, small launch teams
- Core value: launch-readiness scorecard + funnel QA checklist + daily control sheet
- Price framing: **$79 intro (first 20), then $129**

## Channel Priority Stack (in order)

### P1 — Warm DMs (WhatsApp/Telegram/X DMs) [Highest conversion, fastest]
**Why first:** Warm + existing trust = quickest path to leads today.

- Target count: 20–25 sends in first 2 hours
- Message type: short, direct, no fluff, CTA = "want the link?"
- Source: existing contacts, previous collaborators, operator friends, ex-clients

**Success signal:** 20%+ reply rate.

---

### P1 — Email to warm operator list [Scalable + direct CTA]
**Why second:** Can push 20–100 people quickly with a clear pricing deadline.

- Target count: 30–60 sends
- Subject style: launch + urgency + operator utility
- CTA: click to product page / reply "send it"

**Success signal:** 8–12% clicks and at least 5 direct replies.

---

### P2 — X distribution (posts + replies + DM follow-through)
**Why third:** Public proof + inbound + DM handoff.

- Publish: 3 short posts + 1 thread + 15 strategic replies
- Immediate DM anyone engaging with launch/process/compliance pain posts
- CTA: "I can send the exact pre-launch checklist stack"

**Success signal:** 5+ profile visits, 5+ DM conversations.

---

### P2 — LinkedIn outbound to founders/media buyers
**Why:** Better response quality for B2B operator product.

- Target count: 15–25 connection DMs or first messages
- Angle: operational risk reduction before ad spend
- CTA: 2-line audit + product link

**Success signal:** 4+ booked follow-up chats/replies.

---

### P3 — Niche communities (Slack/Discord/Telegram groups)
**Why:** Good for lead quality, but slower and moderation-sensitive.

- Post value-first mini audit framework (not pure promo)
- Offer free "pre-launch gap check" in thread/DM
- Share link only after permission or follow-up request

**Success signal:** 3+ DM pull-ins from group interactions.

## 6-Hour Sprint Cadence

## Block 1 (Hour 0–2): Immediate outbound
1. Send first 25 warm DMs (use message bank file)
2. Send warm email batch #1
3. Post X short post #1 + start replies

## Block 2 (Hour 2–4): Expand + qualify
1. Send 15 LinkedIn messages
2. DM all active X engagers
3. Post in 1–2 relevant communities with value hook

## Block 3 (Hour 4–6): Follow-up + urgency
1. Run 6-hour follow-up on all non-responders
2. Send warm email batch #2 (objection/last-call style)
3. Post X short post #2 with proof + urgency

---

## Qualification Triggers (what counts as high-intent lead)
Mark as high intent if prospect says any of:
- "Send link"
- "How is this different from [course/template]?"
- "Can I see what’s inside?"
- "Do you have this for [vertical]?"
- "Can we jump on a quick call?"

## Response SLAs
- New inbound reply: **respond in < 10 min**
- Link request: send in **< 2 min** with 1-line context
- Objection: answer with proof + short value recap + soft urgency

---

## Risk Controls
- No legal/compliance claims beyond asset scope
- Avoid spam behavior in communities (value-first, permission-based link drop)
- Keep copy short and channel-native

---

## Tracking (minimum viable)
Track each touch in a simple sheet with:
- Name
- Channel
- Warm/Cold
- Sent at
- Follow-up at +6h/+24h
- Status (No reply / Interested / Link sent / Closed)

If execution is tight, this sprint is enough to surface first leads today.
