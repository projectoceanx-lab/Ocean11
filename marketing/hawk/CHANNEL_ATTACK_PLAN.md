# CHANNEL_ATTACK_PLAN

## Objective
Get first leads/sales for Project Ocean kits with fast, low-cost channels before paid scale.

## Priority Order (first 14 days)
1. **Warm network DMs (Telegram/WhatsApp/LinkedIn)**
   - Fastest trust transfer, highest first-response probability.
2. **Founder-led LinkedIn posts + comments**
   - Build authority with truthful operators' insights; CTA to storefront lead form.
3. **Niche communities (Reddit, FB groups, Discord/Slack communities)**
   - Offer tactical value-first posts; soft CTA.
4. **Cold email micro-batches (20–40/day)**
   - Personalized, pain-point led, no hype claims.
5. **X/Twitter tactical threads**
   - Distribution + social proof snippets from frameworks.

## Channel Playbook Snapshot
- **LinkedIn:** 1 post/day + 15 comments/day + 15 DMs/day
- **Telegram/WhatsApp:** 25 warm pings/day
- **Reddit/Groups:** 2 high-value posts/day, no spam
- **Cold Email:** 20/day week 1, 40/day week 2 after response tuning
- **X:** 1 thread + 2 short posts/day

## Offer-channel pairing
- Overnight Launch Kit: affiliates, solo operators, media buyers in launch mode
- Creative Testing Sprint: ad buyers, performance freelancers
- Compliance Preflight: regulated vertical operators
- Weekly Reporting Kit: agencies/freelancers with recurring clients

## KPI assumptions (explicit)
- Assumption: warm DM reply rate 15–30%
- Assumption: cold email reply rate 3–8% initial
- Assumption: conversion from qualified reply to purchase 5–15%
- These are assumptions, not confirmed benchmarks for this account yet.

## Daily cadence
- Morning: 10 warm DMs + 1 post
- Midday: 10 comments + 10 outreach
- Evening: 10 outreach + follow-ups (0h/6h/24h/48h)

## Guardrails
- No guaranteed ROI claims
- No legal/compliance guarantees
- State assumptions clearly
- Route all interest to lead capture if checkout unavailable
