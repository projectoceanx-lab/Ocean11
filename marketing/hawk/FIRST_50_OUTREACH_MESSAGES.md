## A) WhatsApp / Telegram Warm DMs (1–12)

1. {{Name}}, quick one — saw you’re actively launching {{ChannelContext}}. I built an **Overnight Launch Kit** (readiness scorecard + QA checklist + control sheet) for operators. Want the link?

2. Bro {{Name}}, if you’re pushing debt/affiliate funnels this week, this will save setup mistakes. It’s my exact pre-launch stack. $79 intro right now. Want it?

3. {{Name}}, you’re exactly who I built this for: small team, fast launches, no time for messy QA. Want me to send the kit page?

4. Saw your update on {{ChannelContext}} — if you’re testing soon, run this 60-min flow before spend. I packed it into a template kit. Send?

5. {{Name}}, not a course pitch. Pure execution docs: scorecard, funnel QA, daily control sheet. Want the checkout link?

6. You mentioned conversion leaks in {{ChannelContext}}. This kit is basically a leak-prevention workflow before traffic. Should I share it?
