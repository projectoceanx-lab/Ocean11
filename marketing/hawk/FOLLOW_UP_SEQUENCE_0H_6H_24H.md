# Rapid Follow-Up Sequence (0h / 6h / 24h)

Goal: maximize reply rate and qualified lead conversion without sounding spammy.

Use with all channels (DM/email/community), adapting tone per platform.

---

## 0h (Initial Touch)

## Structure
1. Personalized opener (context proof)
2. One-line value proposition
3. One CTA

## DM Script (0h)
Hey {{Name}} — saw {{ChannelContext}}.
I built an **Overnight Launch Kit** for operators (readiness scorecard + QA checklist + control sheet) to reduce launch mistakes before spend.
Want the link?

## Email Script (0h)
Subject: Before your next launch
{{Name}}, if you’re launching soon, I can send a practical pre-launch template stack (scorecard + QA + daily control sheet).
Built for affiliate/debt operators, implementation-first.
Want me to send it?

---

## +6h Follow-Up (Nudge + Value)

Trigger: no response to initial message.

## DM Script (+6h)
Quick bump in case this got buried.
If useful, I can send the 60-minute pre-launch flow we use:
1) readiness scorecard
2) funnel QA pass
3) daily control sheet setup.
Want it?

## Email Script (+6h)
Subject: Re: before your next launch
Quick nudge — sharing because this is usually where teams lose money (setup gaps before traffic).
If relevant, I’ll send the exact workflow + kit link.

---

## +24h Follow-Up (Urgency + Close)

Trigger: still no response after +6h.

## DM Script (+24h)
Last ping, {{Name}} — then I’ll close the loop.
Intro pricing for Overnight Launch Kit is still $79 (moves to $129 after first 20).
Want me to send the link before the price shift?

## Email Script (+24h)
Subject: Last note — closing intro pricing
Final follow-up and I’ll stop nudging.
If you want the launch ops stack at intro pricing ($79), reply “send” and I’ll share immediately.

## Objection-Handling Snippets (drop-in)

**"I can build this myself"**
Totally fair. Most teams can — but delays and skipped steps are what cost money. This gives you ready-to-run structure now.

**"Not launching right now"**
Makes sense. Best use is 24–48h before your next test. Want me to send it so it’s ready when needed?

**"What’s inside exactly?"**
Three core assets: launch readiness scorecard, debt lead funnel QA checklist, daily performance control sheet.

**"Too expensive"**
Understood. It’s priced below one bad test day. If you run launches regularly, ROI is usually immediate.

---

## Cadence Rules (important)
- Max 3 touches in 24h (0h, +6h, +24h)
- If prospect says "not interested," stop and tag closed
- If prospect engages, switch to conversational mode (no automated cadence)
- Reply to inbound within 10 minutes whenever possible

---

## Conversion Micro-CTAs
Use one only per message:
- "Want link?"
- "Reply 'send' and I’ll share"
- "Want the 1-page breakdown first?"
- "Should I send details?"

Short, direct, and respectful wins.
