# FOLLOWUP_SEQUENCE

## Timing sequence

### 0h (immediate after interest)
**Message:**
Thanks for the interest — here’s the exact offer link. If checkout is offline, use the lead form on-page and we’ll complete manual invoice + delivery same day.

### 6h
**Message:**
Quick check-in: did you get what you needed from the offer page? If helpful, I can point you to the best-fit kit in 30 seconds based on your bottleneck.

### 24h
**Message:**
Circling back in case this got buried. If you’re launching/testing this week, I can send a concise fit check so you don’t waste time on the wrong kit.

### 48h
**Message:**
Last follow-up from me. If timing is off, no problem. If you still want it, reply with your top pain point and I’ll send the most relevant option.

## Objection replies

### “Will this guarantee ROI?”
No. We do not guarantee ROI. These are process kits designed to improve execution quality and decision speed.

### “Can this replace legal/compliance counsel?”
No. Compliance pack is operational support only and not legal advice.

### “I can build this myself.”
Valid. The value is speed and structure—so you can apply immediately instead of drafting from scratch.

### “Not now.”
Understood. Want me to follow up next week, or should I close this thread?

### “Checkout isn’t working.”
Use the lead capture form on the page. It saves your details locally, opens a prefilled email draft, and we can process manually.

### “I’m unsure which offer fits.”
Send your current bottleneck (launch quality / creative testing / compliance checks / client reporting), and I’ll recommend one.

## Guardrails
- No pressure language
- No guaranteed outcomes
- Keep claims truthful and specific
- Stop after 48h unless prospect re-engages
