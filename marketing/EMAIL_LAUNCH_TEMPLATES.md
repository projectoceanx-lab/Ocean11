This is implementation-first. No fluff.

**Launch pricing is $79 for first 20 buyers** (then $129).

## Email 2 — Objection Handling + Last Call
**Subject options:**
- Last call before price shift (Overnight Launch Kit)
- If your launch process is ad-hoc, read this
- Closing intro pricing tonight

**Body:**
Hey {{FirstName}},

Quick reminder: intro pricing for **Overnight Launch Kit** is closing.

If you’re thinking “I can build this myself,” you’re right.
But most operators delay, skip steps, and discover issues after spend starts.

This kit gives you:
- a structured pre-launch scorecard
- a clean QA runbook for your funnel
- a control sheet to track conversion health daily

If you launch often, one avoided bad test day can pay for this many times over.

**Grab it now at $79 before it returns to $129:**
