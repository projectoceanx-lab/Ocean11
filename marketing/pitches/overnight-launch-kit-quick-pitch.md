# Overnight Launch Kit — Quick Pitch One-Pager

## ICP (who to send)
- Solo affiliate operators
- Small leadgen teams launching this week
- Anyone saying: “we’re close to launch but messy”

## Core Promise
Launch cleaner by tomorrow with a practical preflight system (not generic advice).

## 20-Second Pitch
"If you’re launching a funnel this week, this gives you the exact readiness scorecard + QA checklist + daily control sheet so you stop leaking money from avoidable setup errors."

## DM Version (copy/paste)
"You launching this week? I built an Overnight Launch Kit that cuts setup chaos fast — scorecard, QA checklist, and daily control sheet. Intro is $79 (then $129). Want the link?"

## Email Version (copy/paste)
Subject: quick launch cleanup before spend goes live

"Hey {{name}},
If you’re launching soon, this might save a rough first 48 hours.
Overnight Launch Kit = practical launch scorecard + QA + daily control sheet.
Intro price is $79 currently.
If useful, I’ll send link + manual invoice fallback in case checkout is down.
— Arif"

## Close Prompt
"Want me to reserve intro pricing and send checkout now?"

## Fallback Purchase Path
- Primary: storefront buy button
- Fallback: "Reply BUY + email" and send manual invoice to project.oceanx@gmail.com

## Objection Quick Hits
- “I can do this myself” → "True, this just compresses it into one focused session so launch doesn’t drift."
- “No guarantee?” → "Correct — no fake guarantees. It improves execution quality and speed."
