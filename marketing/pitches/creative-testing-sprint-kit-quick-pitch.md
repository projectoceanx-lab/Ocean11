# Creative Testing Sprint Kit — Quick Pitch One-Pager

## ICP (who to send)
- Media buyers with ad fatigue
- Performance marketers stuck in random testing loops
- Founders saying: “we test a lot but learn slowly”

## Core Promise
Run structured 5-day creative tests that produce clear winner/loser decisions.

## 20-Second Pitch
"This kit gives you a repeatable sprint framework so each week you know what to scale, what to kill, and why — without guesswork."

## DM Version (copy/paste)
"If your creative testing feels random, this helps: 5-day sprint system with clear pass/fail logic so you stop wasting spend. Intro is $99 (then $149). Want the page?"

## Email Version (copy/paste)
Subject: faster creative wins with less test waste

"Hey {{name}},
Saw your work in paid growth. I made a Creative Testing Sprint Kit for teams that need fast decision velocity.
You get a practical 5-day system to isolate winners and reduce dead-spend tests.
Intro pricing is $99 currently.
Can send direct link + invoice fallback if needed.

## Close Prompt
"Want me to send the direct buy link now?"

## Fallback Purchase Path
- Primary: storefront buy button
- Fallback: manual invoice request through page form or direct email to project.oceanx@gmail.com

## Objection Quick Hits
- “We already test creative” → "Perfect — this improves decision quality and speed, not replaces your process."
- “Team is busy” → "Exactly why this works: lightweight structure, applied in current workflow."
