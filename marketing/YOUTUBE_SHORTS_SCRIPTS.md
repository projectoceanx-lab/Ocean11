# YouTube Shorts Scripts (3) — 45–60 seconds

## Short 1 — “Why launches fail fast”
**Hook (0-5s):**
Most affiliate launches fail in 48 hours — and it’s usually not the ads.

**Body (5-40s):**
It’s broken setup: missing QA, weak tracking, no command sheet. So money goes out and nobody can diagnose what failed. I built Overnight Launch Kit to fix that. You get a launch readiness scorecard, a debt funnel QA checklist, and a daily control sheet you can run in one morning.

**CTA (40-55s):**
If you’re launching soon, use process not guesswork. Link in bio. Intro price is $79 for first 20 buyers.

## Short 2 — “Do this before spending another $200”
**Hook (0-5s):**
Before you spend another $200 on traffic, do this first.

**Body (5-42s):**
Run a 60-minute launch audit: readiness scorecard, full checkout QA, one real test purchase, and a daily metrics sheet. Most operators skip this and end up paying tuition to obvious mistakes. Overnight Launch Kit gives you the exact templates so you can execute fast and clean.

**CTA (42-58s):**
If you want to launch this week with fewer blind spots, grab the kit. Link in bio.

## Short 3 — “Simple math to $1k/week”
**Hook (0-6s):**
Here’s simple launch math for a small digital ops product.

**Body (6-43s):**
Goal is $1,000 per week. At $79, you need about 13 sales. At $129, around 8. In launch week with blended pricing, call it 12 sales. At a 2.1% funnel conversion, that’s around 572 visitors a week — about 82 a day. This is achievable with consistent posts, email, DMs, and partner pushes.

**CTA (43-60s):**
If you want the exact execution templates, Overnight Launch Kit is live now. Link in bio.
