# Reply Handling Playbook (First Purchases)

Assumptions:
- Manual invoice flow is required until all checkouts are fully connected.
- Speed to response is a conversion lever; target first response in <10 minutes during active blocks.

## 1) Reply Triage (within 60 seconds)
Tag each reply as:
1. **Hot** (asks price/link/timeline)
2. **Warm** (asks questions, mild interest)
3. **Cold** (not now / maybe later)
4. **Not fit** (wrong ICP)

Action:
- Hot: send close script immediately.
- Warm: answer + one proof point + soft close.
- Cold: set follow-up window.
- Not fit: politely exit.

## 2) Universal Close Script
"Makes sense. Fastest path: I’ll send you the direct buy link now. If checkout glitches, just reply **BUY + your email** and I’ll issue a manual invoice immediately."

## 3) Objection Tree

### Objection: "Need to think"
Response:
- "Totally fair. What part do you need clarity on — fit, timing, or ROI?"
- Then narrow and solve one blocker.
- Close: "If I clear that blocker now, are you good to move today at intro price?"

### Objection: "Too expensive"
Response:
- "Understood. Biggest cost is usually delayed launch / wasted testing week. This is priced to recover that faster."
- Offer binary close: "Want single kit now, or bundle discount to reduce total?"

### Objection: "No time"
Response:
- "That’s why this sells — it removes planning overhead. You can apply the first pass in under an hour."
- Close: "Should I send now so your team can use it this week?"

### Objection: "Send details"
Response:
- "Sure — 1) who it’s for, 2) what’s inside, 3) how to buy/fallback."
- End with CTA: "Want checkout or manual invoice?"

### Objection: "Is this guaranteed?"
Response:
- "No fake guarantees. It improves execution speed and quality; outcomes depend on your traffic/offer execution."
- Close: "If that expectation is clear, want the link now?"

## 4) Fast Close Sequences

### Sequence A (hot lead)
1. "Perfect, sending link now."
2. Send storefront URL.
3. "If checkout fails, reply BUY + email; manual invoice in minutes."
4. Follow-up in 15 min if no confirmation.

### Sequence B (warm lead)
1. Clarify pain in one question.
2. Match to one offer only (no overwhelm).
3. Ask commitment: "Want me to lock intro pricing today?"

## 5) Fallback Invoice Instructions (exact)
When buyer says yes but cannot pay on page:
1. Ask: "Use this format: BUY + Offer Name + Best email"
2. Draft/send invoice request email to `project.oceanx@gmail.com`
3. Reply confirmation script:
   - "Got it. Invoice is being issued manually. Once paid, delivery link is sent to this email."
4. Track status: sent → paid → delivered.

## 6) Payment-Ready Message Templates

### DM payment template
"Great — to complete now, send: **BUY | {{Offer}} | {{Email}}**. I’ll issue manual invoice immediately if checkout doesn’t load."

### Email payment template
Subject: payment step for {{Offer}}

"Thanks {{name}},
To complete purchase, use checkout link here: {{url}}
If checkout fails, reply with BUY + this email and we’ll issue manual invoice right away.
— Project Ocean"

## 7) Follow-up Cadence
- +15 min: quick nudge
- +4 hours: urgency nudge (intro price window)
- +24 hours: last call + fallback invoice option

## 8) Conversion Benchmarks (operator targets)
- Hot replies to paid: **>=30%**
- Warm replies to paid: **>=15%**
- Invoice sent to paid: **>=40%**
- If below 10% close overall: tighten ICP and simplify close to one CTA.

## 9) Non-Negotiables
- One clear CTA per message.
- Always include fallback purchase instruction.
- Never argue with low-intent leads.
- Prioritize speed and clarity over long persuasion.
