# Social Post Blocks

Use these structures for trust-building and qualified intent, not hype.

## Block 1: Empathy + Practical Next Step
1. Hook: problem recognition without fear-mongering.
2. Context: one clear sentence on why the issue matters.
3. Action: one compliant CTA.

Example CTA:
- `Explore Debt Relief Options`

## Block 2: Myth vs Reality
1. Hook: common misconception.
2. Reality: short correction with neutral language.
3. Action: single next step.

Example CTA:
- `Check Your Options`

## Block 3: Decision Checklist
1. Hook: "Before you choose, review these 3 points."
2. Value: 2-3 bullets, concise and non-promissory.
3. Action: one CTA.

Example CTA:
- `See If You Qualify`

## Constraints
- No guarantee language.
- No government-affiliation implication.
- One primary CTA per post.
