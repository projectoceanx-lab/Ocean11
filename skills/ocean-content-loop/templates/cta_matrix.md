# CTA Matrix

Map objective -> channel -> CTA. Use only allowlisted CTAs.

| Objective | Email | Social |
|---|---|---|
| Qualified Clicks | See If You Qualify | Check Your Options |
| Lead Starts | View Matched Options | Explore Debt Relief Options |
| Trust Build | Get Free Eligibility Check | See Available Loan Offers |

## Rules
- Use one primary CTA per asset.
- CTA text must exactly match allowlist entry in `config/copy_lexicon.yaml`.
- CTA destination must match approved route/offer for that batch.
