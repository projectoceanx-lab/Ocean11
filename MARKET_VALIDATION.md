## Commercial viability math

### Required unit sales to hit $1,000/week
- At **$79**: 1000 / 79 = **12.7** → **13 sales/week**
- At **$129**: 1000 / 129 = **7.8** → **8 sales/week**

### Net after Gumroad direct-link fee (10% + $0.50)
- Net at $79: 79 - 7.90 - 0.50 = **$70.60**
- Net at $129: 129 - 12.90 - 0.50 = **$115.60**

Weekly net targets:
- $1,000 / $70.60 = **15 sales/week** at $79 net
- $1,000 / $115.60 = **9 sales/week** at $129 net

## Why this product can sell
1. It targets a pain with direct dollar impact (launch mistakes burn ad spend fast).
2. It is implementation-first (scorecards/checklists/sheet), not theory-heavy.
3. It can be sold to warm founder/operator network before paid traffic.

## Risks
1. Low-ticket template products are competitive; distribution matters more than product quality.
2. No testimonials yet (conversion drag initially).
3. Checkout/platform friction if account setup is incomplete.

## Decision
- Keep intro at **$79** for first tranche, then move to **$129** once first 10-20 buyer testimonials are captured.
- Primary KPI: time-to-first-10-sales and refund rate.
