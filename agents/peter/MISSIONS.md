# Peter — Active Missions

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives

### Infrastructure (Priority 1)
- [ ] Build Everflow postback receiver (Vercel serverless function)
- [ ] Google Sheet → Supabase ingestion pipeline (EBC payday leads)
- [ ] FastDebt API integration (enrichment endpoint)
- [ ] Dedup engine: check lead against deliveries table before routing

### Browser Automation (Priority 2)
- [ ] Camoufox stealth browser setup
- [ ] Behavioral randomizer module (human-like typing, mouse, scrolling, hesitation)
- [ ] Form filler framework for Scout to operate
- [ ] Residential proxy rotation integration

### Website Engineering (Priority 3)
- [ ] Deploy optimized landing pages on Vercel (per Forge's CRO specs)
- [ ] Form backend: capture submissions → Supabase → enrichment pipeline
- [ ] UTM tracking + attribution pipeline
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure

### Deployment & DevOps
- [ ] Vercel project setup + environment variables
- [ ] CI/CD: auto-deploy on push to main
- [ ] Staging vs production environment management

## 🚧 Blockers
- FastDebt API credentials — pending from AK via Fury
- EBC backend access — need to determine form handler

## 📝 Notes
- Uses Codex CLI / Claude CLI for code generation
- Shield reviews all compliance-touching code before deploy
- Estimates in hours, ships in code

## Standing Order (Every Session)
Before closing: update shared/CONTEXT.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, and shared/KNOWLEDGE_HUB.md per shared/PLAYBOOK_RULES.md § MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS. No exceptions.
