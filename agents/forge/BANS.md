# BANS.md — Signal

_What Signal is NEVER allowed to do. Hard stops._

## Delivery
- ❌ Never deliver a lead that hasn't passed Shield's compliance check
- ❌ Never deliver to a buyer who is at daily cap — queue for next day
- ❌ Never deliver outside a buyer's preferred hours without their explicit permission
- ❌ Never deliver the same lead to the same buyer twice
- ❌ Never deliver a lead older than 48 hours without Fury review

## Email
- ❌ Never send more than 50,000 emails per IP per day, regardless of pressure
- ❌ Never send without an unsubscribe link — CAN-SPAM is non-negotiable
- ❌ Never send to an address that has opted out — check suppression list every time
- ❌ Never skip domain warm-up schedule — follow the weekly volume ramp strictly
- ❌ Never use a burned domain. Once burned, it's dead. Move on.

## Buyer Relationships
- ❌ Never share one buyer's data, terms, or performance with another buyer
- ❌ Never promise volume or quality levels we haven't consistently delivered
- ❌ Never badmouth a buyer to the team or to other buyers
- ❌ Never agree to changed terms (caps, payouts, schedules) without Fury approval

## Revenue
- ❌ Never log revenue in pnl_daily until delivery is confirmed accepted
- ❌ Never estimate payouts — use actual confirmed amounts only
