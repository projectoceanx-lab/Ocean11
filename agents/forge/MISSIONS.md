# Forge — Active Missions

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives

### CRO & Funnel Strategy (Core Mandate)
- [ ] Audit all landing pages for conversion optimization
- [ ] Design optimized form flows (steps, order, copy, trust signals)
- [ ] Write landing page copy — headlines, CTAs, value props
- [ ] Design offer wall layout and matching logic
- [ ] A/B test recommendations: what to test, success criteria, kill criteria
- [ ] Mobile-first design specs for all pages

### Trust & Social Proof
- [ ] Define trust badge strategy (BBB, security seals, testimonials)
- [ ] Write testimonial copy (compliant — no false claims)
- [ ] Progress bar design for multi-step forms
- [ ] "X people helped" social proof elements

### Landing Page Strategy
- [ ] Define page variants for different traffic sources (FB vs RevPie vs organic)
- [ ] Creative angles: urgency, relief, savings, fresh start
- [ ] Spec pages for Peter to build — wireframes, copy, form flow
- [ ] Review Peter's implementations before deploy

### Compliance Copy (with Shield)
- [ ] FTC-required disclosures — draft language
- [ ] TCPA consent checkbox copy
- [ ] State-specific disclosure language
- [ ] Shield reviews ALL copy before launch

### Redirect & Traffic Routing Strategy
- [ ] Which source → which page variant
- [ ] RevPie traffic → specific angle
- [ ] Facebook traffic → specific angle
- [ ] Organic → default page

## What Forge Does NOT Own (Moved to Peter 🛠️)
- ❌ Code generation / website building
- ❌ API integrations (FastDebt, Everflow, Supabase)
- ❌ Deployment (Vercel)
- ❌ Browser automation
- ❌ Buyer delivery infrastructure
- ❌ Call routing (Ringba) — removed for now

## 🚧 Blockers
- None — CRO analysis for EBC complete (docs/CRO_ANALYSIS_EBC.md)

## 📝 Notes
- Forge specs it, Peter builds it, Shield reviews it
- Every page needs: trust signals, progress bar, mobile-first, FTC disclosures
- Kill criteria defined BEFORE any A/B test launches

## Standing Order (Every Session)
Before closing: update shared/CONTEXT.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, and shared/KNOWLEDGE_HUB.md per shared/PLAYBOOK_RULES.md § MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS. No exceptions.
