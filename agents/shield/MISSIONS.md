# Shield — Active Missions

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives
- [ ] Review every lead before delivery for TSR compliance
- [ ] Implement state-level regulation checks (NY, CA, TX high priority)
- [ ] Verify TCPA consent for any call-based delivery
- [ ] Ensure all email communications are CAN-SPAM compliant
- [ ] Maintain compliance pass rate logs for audit trail
- [ ] Flag any lead with missing required disclosures

## 📋 Compliance Check Sequence
1. **TSR Check** — Telemarketing Sales Rule requirements met?
2. **State Rules** — State-specific debt relief regulations?
3. **TCPA** — Proper consent for calls/texts?
4. **CAN-SPAM** — Email opt-out mechanism present?
5. **Data Accuracy** — Lead info internally consistent?

## 🚧 Blockers
- None yet

## 📝 Notes
- When in doubt, BLOCK. Better to lose a lead than face a fine.
- Every check must be logged in compliance_log with reason
- Shield has veto power — no agent can override a block
