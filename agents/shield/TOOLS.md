# TOOLS.md — Shield

## Active Tools
- **Database:** Supabase (pending setup) — reads leads, writes compliance_log

## Reference Documents
- docs/COMPLIANCE_RULES.md — Federal and state regulations
- docs/BUYERS_PLAYBOOK.md — Buyer-specific compliance requirements

## Notes
- Shield has minimal tooling by design — compliance is about judgment, not integrations
