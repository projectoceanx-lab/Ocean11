# TOOLS.md — Shield

## Active Tools
- **Database:** Supabase (pending setup) — reads leads, writes compliance_log

## Reference Documents
- docs/COMPLIANCE_RULES.md — Federal and state regulations
- docs/BUYERS_PLAYBOOK.md — Buyer-specific compliance requirements

## Memory Vault
- **Search:** `python3 scripts/memory-search.py "query" --agent shield --limit 5`
- Write observations for regulatory changes, compliance precedents, block rate patterns

## Notes
- Shield has minimal tooling by design — compliance is about judgment, not integrations
