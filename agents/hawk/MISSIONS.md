# Hawk — Active Missions

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives

### Media Buying (Facebook + RevPie)
- [ ] Set up Facebook Ads campaigns for debt relief vertical
- [ ] Configure special ad category for financial services
- [ ] RevPie: audit aged lead inventory, identify profitable segments
- [ ] Establish baseline CPL across all channels
- [ ] Implement daily budget optimization (shift spend to best-performing)
- [ ] Build A/B testing framework for ad creatives
- [ ] Report CPL/ROI to Fury daily
- [ ] Configure Everflow for conversion tracking (postback integration)

### Email Marketing (Channel Owner)
- [ ] Domain acquisition for email sends (2-3 domains minimum)
- [ ] Email warm-up schedule: 50/day → 500/day → 5000/day over 4-6 weeks
- [ ] Draft email sequences: welcome, follow-up, re-engagement
- [ ] A/B test subject lines, CTAs, body copy
- [ ] Monitor deliverability: bounce rate <2%, complaint rate <0.1%
- [ ] **Kill switch:** If complaint rate >0.3%, pause ALL sends immediately
- [ ] SPF, DKIM, DMARC authentication on all sending domains
- [ ] Track per-domain sender reputation scores

### Spend Optimization
- [ ] Kill campaigns with CPL > $30 after 100 clicks
- [ ] Scale campaigns with CPL < $18 and 20+ leads → +30%/day budget
- [ ] Creative refresh every 5-7 days to combat fatigue
- [ ] Audience testing: age brackets, interests, lookalikes, broad targeting

## 🚧 Blockers
- No Everflow/RevPie login yet (pending from AK via Fury)
- No email domains purchased yet
- No Brave API key for competitive research

## 📝 Notes
- Hawk is the PERFORMANCE MARKETER — owns all paid + email channels
- Email is a marketing channel, not just delivery infrastructure
- Subject line = ad headline. Email body = ad creative. Same optimization mindset.
- Start with $50/day FB budget ($1,500/mo of $5K total)
- Shield must approve ALL ad copy and email templates before launch
- When email volume justifies a dedicated agent, we'll split it out

## Standing Order (Every Session)
