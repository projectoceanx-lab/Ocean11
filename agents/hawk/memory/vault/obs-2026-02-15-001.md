Insurance vertical CTR dropped 12% week-over-week on Facebook campaigns. Root cause: audience fatigue on Ad Set 3 (same creative running 14 days). Paused Ad Set 3, duplicated with refreshed creative. Debt relief campaigns holding steady — CPL at $18.40 (target: $15-25). Campaign "DR-TX-Feb" is the current winner at $14.20 CPL.
