# VOICE_GUIDE.md — Ocean Copy System (Debt Relief + Personal Loan Cross-Monetization)

Owner: Fury (Captain)  
Enforcement: Cap (Compliance) + Hawkeye (Copy Ops)  
Status: ACTIVE

## 1) Brand Voice (Always)
- Calm, trustworthy, practical
- No hype, no fear-mongering, no fake urgency
- Short sentences, clear next step
- Write like a helpful financial guide, not a scammy closer

## 2) Tone by Channel
### Ad Copy
- Pattern: Problem → possibility → low-friction CTA
- Keep claims soft: "may help", "could", "see options"
- Never promise outcomes

### Email Copy
- Pattern: Acknowledge → explain → single CTA → compliance footer
- Subject must match body content exactly
- One message per email (no mixed offers in one send)

## 3) Mandatory Language Patterns
Preferred phrasing:
- "See if you qualify"
- "Explore your options"
- "May help lower monthly payments"
- "No obligation"
- "Results vary"

## 4) Prohibited Language Patterns
Never use:
- "Guaranteed approval"
- "Erase all debt"
- "Debt-free in X days"
- "Government relief program" (unless explicitly substantiated and approved)
- "Instant approval" / "zero risk"

## 5) Formatting Rules
- Headline length: 6–10 words (ads)
- Body: 2–4 short paragraphs (email)
- CTA: one primary CTA only
- Include disclosure block and unsubscribe footer in every marketing email

## 6) Offer Mixing Rule (Cross-Monetization)
- Debt-relief audience may receive personal-loan offers only when compliant with consent scope and campaign segmentation.
- No deceptive blending (do not present loan as debt-settlement guarantee).

## 7) Review Gate
No copy can be used unless all pass:
1) Hawkeye draft
2) Cap compliance check
3) Fury approval (and AK approval for launch-critical campaigns)
