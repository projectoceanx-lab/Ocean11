# SALES NOW COMMAND CENTER

Assumptions (explicit):
- Checkout may still be disconnected on some pages, so invoice fallback is primary close path today.
- Founder bandwidth is limited; this board is operator-executable without additional approvals.
- First goal is first paid orders (proof of demand), then optimize channel mix.

## 1) Today’s Non-Negotiable Targets (D0)
- **Outbound volume:** 120 targeted contacts sent today.
- **Reply target:** 18+ replies (15% response rate floor).
- **Call/chat target:** 6 buying conversations.
- **Closed-won target:** 3 purchases minimum (mixed offers accepted).
- **Revenue floor today:** **$250+** from initial sales.

## 2) Outreach Quotas (Today)
- X/Twitter DMs or replies: **40**
- LinkedIn DMs: **30**
- Indie Hackers / communities / Slack / Discord: **25**
- Newsletter operator cold emails: **25**
- Follow-up wave (same day, 4–8h later) to non-responders: **40**

## 3) Offer Routing Rules (Sell What Fits Fast)
- If they mention launch chaos / setup confusion → **Overnight Launch Kit ($79)**
- If they mention ad fatigue / testing waste → **Creative Testing Sprint Kit ($99)**
- If they mention policy fear / rejections / compliance anxiety → **Compliance Preflight Pack ($119)**
- If they run agency/freelance reporting workflows → **Weekly Client Reporting Kit ($69)**

## 4) Scripts (Copy/Paste)

### First-touch DM (short)
"Quick one — I built a plug-and-play [offer type] kit for operators who need results this week, not theory. Intro is $[price] right now. Want the 1-page breakdown?"

### First-touch email
Subject: fast win for your [funnel/creative/reporting] workflow

"Hey {{name}},
Saw you’re actively shipping in {{niche}}. I put together a practical kit to solve {{pain point}} fast.
- What it does: {{result}}
- Time to apply: same day
- Intro price: ${{price}} (temporary)
If useful, I’ll send the direct page + invoice fallback (in case checkout is down).
— Arif"

### Follow-up nudge (4–8h)
"Closing loop in case this helps: still have intro slot for {{offer}} today. If checkout fails, I can issue invoice manually in 2 mins. Want me to send it?"

## 5) Conversion Thresholds (Decision Gates)
- If response rate < 8% after 80 sends → rewrite opener and tighten ICP before next 40 sends.
- If positive reply rate > 20% but closes < 10% → improve close script + clearer payment CTA.
- If close rate > 20% on one offer → shift 60% of remaining outreach to that offer angle.
- If 2+ prospects stall at checkout → immediately force invoice fallback in-message.

## 6) Execution Blocks (Today)
- **Block A (0–2h):** Send first 60 targeted messages.
- **Block B (2–4h):** Handle replies live; push to invoice or checkout link.
- **Block C (4–6h):** Send next 60 + first follow-ups.
- **Block D (6–8h):** Close window: “intro pricing ends tonight” nudge + invoice links.

## 7) Closing Standard (Always Include)
"If checkout doesn’t load, reply with **BUY + your email** and I’ll send manual invoice + delivery immediately."

## 9) Immediate Priority Sequence
1. Sell Overnight Launch Kit first (lowest friction + clear value + low ticket).
2. Upsell Creative Testing Sprint Kit to ad operators who reply positively.
3. Bundle offer for warm leads: Overnight + Creative = $149 same-day close.
4. Keep Compliance Pack as high-intent add-on for risk-sensitive buyers.
