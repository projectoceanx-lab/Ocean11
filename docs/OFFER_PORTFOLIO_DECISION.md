# Offer Portfolio Decision — Ocean Digital Products

Date: 2026-02-21  
Owner: Ocean (subagent proposal)

## Scope
Compare 4 offers:
1. Overnight Launch Kit (existing)
2. Creative Testing Sprint Kit (new)
3. Compliance Preflight Pack (new)
4. Weekly Client Reporting Kit (new)

## Scoring Method
Scale: 1 (low) to 5 (high).  
Criteria required: speed to launch, sales probability, margin, differentiation, path to $1k/week.

> Explicit assumptions (not yet validated with live sales data):
> - Distribution starts from founder-led outbound + organic social (no paid ads in first 48h)
> - Delivery is digital files only (near-zero COGS)
> - Conversion benchmarks are estimated from low-ticket digital ops products in adjacent performance-marketing audiences
> - Time-to-launch assumes assets in this repo are “sellable MVP,” not fully polished v2 products

## Comparison Table

| Offer | Speed to Launch | Sales Probability | Margin | Differentiation | Path to $1k/week | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Overnight Launch Kit | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 4 | Already built; fastest monetization path |
| Creative Testing Sprint Kit | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | Strong pain point, clear repeat use |
| Compliance Preflight Pack | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 3 | High-value niche, but buyers may expect legal advisory depth |
| Weekly Client Reporting Kit | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | Broad buyer base (freelancers/agencies), lower price but high volume potential |

## Quick Economics (assumption-based)

- **Overnight Launch Kit** @ $79 intro → ~$1k/week needs ~13 sales/week
- **Creative Testing Sprint Kit** @ $99 intro → ~$1k/week needs ~11 sales/week
- **Compliance Preflight Pack** @ $119 intro → ~$1k/week needs ~9 sales/week
- **Weekly Client Reporting Kit** @ $69 intro → ~$1k/week needs ~15 sales/week

These are arithmetic targets only, not forecast certainty.

## Recommendation

## Primary Offer: **Overnight Launch Kit**
Why:
- Highest readiness (already packaged with storefront + assets)
- Fastest path to immediate cash validation
- Strong fit with current Ocean identity and capabilities

## Secondary Offer: **Creative Testing Sprint Kit**
Why:
- Adjacent audience overlap with launch-kit buyers
- Clear operational value and recurring use (weekly testing cadence)
- Easier upsell path into implementation support or agency license

## Sequencing Plan
1. Push Overnight Launch Kit for immediate conversions (Days 1–3)
2. Cross-sell Creative Testing Sprint Kit to same leads (Days 3–7)
3. Introduce Compliance Preflight Pack as premium add-on for regulated buyers
4. Keep Weekly Client Reporting Kit as broader-market volume offer for freelancers/agencies

## Evidence Status
- **Available now:** product readiness evidence (files/storefronts present in repo)
- **Missing:** live conversion and refund data by offer
- **Action needed:** run each 48-hour validation plan and log outcomes in MARKET_VALIDATION.md + shared/METRICS.md
