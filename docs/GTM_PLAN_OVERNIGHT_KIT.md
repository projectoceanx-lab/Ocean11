_Last updated: 2026-02-21 (Asia/Dubai)_

## Goal
Hit **$1,000/week in gross sales** for Overnight Launch Kit within 14 days of launch using operator-led channels (X, email, DMs, affiliates, and short-form video).

---

## Offer Snapshot
- Product: Overnight Launch Kit (templates + SOPs + checklists)
- Buyer: affiliate/debt leadgen operators, small teams, media buyers
- Intro price: **$79**
- Standard price: **$129 after first 20 buyers**

### Positioning
“Launch your debt leadgen micro-funnel in one morning with fewer blind spots and cleaner decision control.”

## Revenue Math (Explicit)

## Target Weekly Revenue
- Primary target: **$1,000/week gross**

## Price Scenarios
1. **If all sales at $79**
   - Required weekly sales = 1000 / 79 = **12.7 → 13 sales/week**

2. **If all sales at $129**
   - Required weekly sales = 1000 / 129 = **7.75 → 8 sales/week**

3. **Blended launch scenario (recommended)**
   - First 20 units at $79, then $129
   - Week target planning assumption: blended AOV **$89** in first week (because most early sales at intro tier)
   - Required weekly sales = 1000 / 89 = **11.2 → 12 sales/week**

### Working KPI Target (Week 1)
- Sales target: **12 sales/week**
- Daily target: **~2 sales/day for 6 days**

---

## Funnel Math Assumptions (Week 1)

Assume:
- Landing page conversion to checkout start: **6%**
- Checkout completion from checkout start: **35%**
- LP visitor → purchase conversion: **2.1%** (0.06 × 0.35)

To get 12 purchases/week:
- Required visitors = 12 / 0.021 = **572 visitors/week** (~82/day)

Traffic split assumption:
- X organic + threads: 45% (257 visitors)
- Email list + partner email: 20% (114 visitors)
- Outbound DM + affiliates/operators: 25% (143 visitors)
- YouTube Shorts + repurposed clips: 10% (58 visitors)

At 2.1% CVR, 572 visitors ≈ 12 sales.

> If CVR drops to 1.5%, visitor need rises to 800/week. Mitigation: improve landing proof and simplify checkout.

## Channel Strategy (Operator-Focused)

## 1) X (Primary Demand Capture)
**Role:** fast attention + authority + CTA clicks.

Execution:
- 2 short posts/day (pain, cost of delay, launch control)
- 3 long threads/week (playbooks, teardown, “before spend checklist”)
- CTA always points to offer page with UTM tags

KPI targets:
- CTR on short posts: 1.5%+
- CTR on threads: 2.5%+
- Weekly traffic from X: **250+ visits**

## 2) Email (Warm Intent Conversion)
**Role:** convert existing warm audience.

Execution:
- Email #1: launch + intro price urgency
- Email #2: case-style proof + objection handling + last call
- Optional resend to non-openers after 24h with new subject line

KPI targets:
- Open rate: 35%+
- CTR: 3–5%
- Purchase CVR from email traffic: 3%+

## 3) Outbound DMs to Affiliates/Operators
**Role:** direct deal flow + partner referrals.

Execution:
- Send 40–60 highly targeted DMs/day (X/Telegram/LinkedIn)
- Use 4 template variants (cold, warm, affiliate split, “operator rescue”)
- Follow-up at +24h and +72h

KPI targets:
- Response rate: 15%+
- Click rate from responders: 40%+
- Conversion from clicks: 4%+

## 4) Affiliate/Operator Micro-Partners
**Role:** leverage other operators’ audiences.

Execution:
- Recruit 10 partners with simple rev share (example: 30%)
- Give each partner: copy pack + tracked link + 2 post options + email swipe
- Run 7-day sprint leaderboard; highlight top referrer

KPI targets:
- 10 active partners
- 3+ partners sending clicks in first week
- Partner-attributed sales: 3+/week

## 5) YouTube Shorts (Trust Layer)
**Role:** top-of-funnel credibility and repurposable clips.

Execution:
- 3 shorts/week (45–60s)
- Structure: problem → costly failure → kit outcome → CTA
- Repost to IG Reels/TikTok if available

KPI targets:
- Combined 1,500+ views/week
- 2% profile/link CTR

---

## Pricing & Offer Mechanics
- Launch week: **$79 (first 20 buyers)**
- Then shift to **$129** immediately after cap is hit
- Add urgency copy: “20 intro seats only; then auto-switch to standard”
- Light guarantee copy (operational): “If files are incomplete/corrupt, fixed within 24h”

---

## Week-1 Cadence
- Day 1: announce + 1 thread + email #1 + 40 DMs
- Day 2: objection post + partner outreach + follow-ups
- Day 3: thread #2 + short #1 + proof update
- Day 4: feature breakdown post + DM wave #2
- Day 5: thread #3 + email #2 (last call)
- Day 6: urgency post + partner reminder
- Day 7: recap + report + optimize weak step in funnel

---

## Risk Controls + Kill Criteria

Red flags:
- LP→purchase CVR below **1%** after 300 visitors
- Checkout start rate below **4%**
- Refund rate above **10%**

Actions:
1. If CVR <1%: rewrite hero + tighten CTA + add clearer deliverable bullets.
2. If checkout starts low: simplify pricing block and remove extra friction.
3. If refunds high: tighten expectation copy (“templates/SOPs, not done-for-you launches”).
