# Overnight Launch Kit — Status Summary

## Fully done
- Built complete product package at `products/overnight-launch-kit/`:
  - `PRODUCT.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.txt`
  - `assets/hero.svg`
  - `bundle/` with 3 practical operator assets:
    - `launch-readiness-scorecard.md`
    - `debt-lead-funnel-qa-checklist.md`
    - `daily-performance-control-sheet.csv`
- Built static storefront at `storefront/overnight-launch-kit/`:
  - `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
  - Includes persuasive copy, feature sections, FAQ, and clear CTA
- Added launch docs:
  - `LAUNCH_ACTION_ITEMS.md`
  - `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`

## Partially done
- Public deployment attempted via Vercel CLI but blocked by account billing status.
- CTA behavior supports manual fallback message, but final live checkout URL is pending credentials.

## Blockers (true blockers only)
1. **Vercel team billing overdue (402)** blocks production deploy.
2. **No checkout credentials/link present** (Stripe/PayPal/Gumroad), so direct self-serve purchase flow cannot be completed autonomously.

## Recommended launch price
**$79 intro (first 20 buyers), then $129.**

Rationale: Low-friction entry point for affiliate operators, while still high ROI relative to cost of one failed launch day. The $129 step-up is justified after initial buyers/testimonials prove value.
