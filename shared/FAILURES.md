# Failure Log — Learn or Repeat

_Every failure gets logged here with root cause and lesson. If we make the same mistake twice, we didn't learn._

---

## Format

```
### [DATE] — [AGENT] — Short Title
**What happened:** What went wrong
**Root cause:** Why it happened (dig deep — "it broke" is not a root cause)
**Impact:** What it cost us (dollars, leads lost, time wasted, reputation damage)
**Lesson:** What we do differently now
**Prevention:** Specific change made (config, workflow, rule) to prevent recurrence
```

## Failures

<!-- Nothing yet — we're pre-launch. But when they come (and they will), log them honestly. -->
<!-- The goal isn't zero failures. It's zero REPEATED failures. -->
