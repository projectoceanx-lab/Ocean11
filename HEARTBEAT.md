# HEARTBEAT.md — Fury Standing Orders

Every heartbeat (30 min), check:

1. **Agent status** — Are sub-agents responsive? Any silent > 1h?
2. **Pipeline** — Leads acquired vs delivered in last 24h
3. **P&L** — Revenue, costs, margin for today
4. **Blockers** — Anything stopping lead flow?
5. **Compliance** — Shield block rate normal?

If Phase 1 not yet live: check setup progress and blockers instead.

If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
