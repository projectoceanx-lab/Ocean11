Implemented Copy Guardrails System v1 to prevent ad/email style drift and compliance risk:
- Added voice guide, copy lexicon, CTA library, and controlled debt-relief + personal-loan email templates.
- Established enforced workflow: Hawkeye drafts, Cap reviews, Fury approves.
- Added weekly regulatory intelligence + follow-through loops to convert CFPB/FTC/FCC/state updates into owner actions and shared context updates.
