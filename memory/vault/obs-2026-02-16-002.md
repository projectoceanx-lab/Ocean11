Daily all-agent sync confirmed no pipeline or P&L movement (0 acquired, 0 delivered, $0 revenue, $0 spend). Highest-priority operational risks remain infrastructure blockers, not performance: offer caps still pending from AK, FastDebt integration not live, and offer_caps schema not yet executed. Reliability risk persists from intermittent Watchtower/Kimi fallback and one memory-maintenance cron model-access failure. Action focus should stay on phase-1 readiness gates (schema + compliance check + second form mapping) before any traffic activation.
